<p><b>SOFT COOKIE EATERS BE WARNED.</b> If you're a Soft Cookie Eater, you may be looking at this picture and immediately dismiss these cookies them for their rigidity, but I <i>promise</i> these will have you re-evaluating all of your beliefs. I have a theory that people who prefer deep dish pizza also tend to favor a gooier cookie, so if you hail from Chicago and have no interest in having your values converted, you may as well turn around now. </p>
<h2>These cookies are...</h2>
<ul>
	<li>Perfectly thin</li>
	<li>Rich and buttery</li>
	<li>Crispy on the edges</li>
	<li>Balanced with a hint of sea salt</li>
</ul>
<h2>To make these, you'll need:</h2>
<ul>
<li>2 sticks of butter</li>
<li>2 cups all-purpose flour</li>
<li>1 teaspoon sea salt</li>
<li>3/4 cup sugar</li>
<li>3/4 cup dark brown sugar</li>
<li>1 tsp water</li>
<li>1 tsp vanilla</li>
<li>2 eggs</li>
<li>2 cups of dark chocolate chips</li>
</ul>

</ul>
<h2>Directions</h2>
<ol>
<li>Pre-heat oven to 350&deg; F</li>
<li>Grease 2 cookie sheets</li>
<li>In a large bowl, stir together flour, baking soda, and salt</li>
<li>In another bowl, mix the butter, sugars, water, and vanilla until smooth</li>
