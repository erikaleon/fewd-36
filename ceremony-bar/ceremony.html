<div class="about"
data-center-top="opacity:0.8;"

	<p class="about-paragraph">Ceremony combines the rich traditions of Mexican heritage with European Cuisine. It is the latest venture from owner and Chef Frank Leon, the force behind neighboring hot spots La Loggia Italian Bistro and The Village.</p>

	<p class="about-paragraph">Graffiti style art and Dia de Los Muertos murals painted throughout the restaurant invite guests to reimagine the vibrant neighborhoods and culture of Mexico, while creating new experiences of their own. The 2200 square­foot restaurant and 800 square­foot patio will feature a 17 x 7 foot retractable wall which opens up to the street of Ventura Boulevard. A restored 1969 VW Kombi Bus will be used as a taco stand serving Baja California ​style tacos, as well as Cuban sandwiches. Leon was inspired by the movie “Chef,” along with his Cuban heritage, in his creation of Ceremony. Other unique features include a signature complimentary shoeshine service available to all guests outside the entrance. Leon’s clubbing days in the 80’s, when all the club bathrooms offered shoeshine service, was the inspiration for this signature touch. The VIP Library Room, located upstairs, is the perfect space for a private event. The space holds 20 people and offers entertainment for guests.</p>

	<p class="about-paragraph">Ceremony will offer a full bar with signature, handcrafted cocktails curated by The Village’s head mixologist Matty Taylor. “The inspiration for the cocktail menu came after my trip to Tulum, Mexico. I fell in love with their use of mezcal, hibiscus and fresh tropical fruits. When you sip on our cocktails, your taste buds will feel like their vacationing on sandy white beaches.” The menu will also offer a tightly edited selection of artisan beers and a comprehensive wine selection that is sure to please even the pickiest of palates</p>
